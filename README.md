How do I approach designing software?

The first thing that I had to do was a lot of research on what the IDE was that I was going to be using. Then I had to learn the basics on how it works, what coding languages I could use with it, etc.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I never thought that I would be able to recreate a scene using only code. Honestly, when I first started this class I assumed there would be a way for me to just generate a cube, I had no idea it would rely so heavily on the code itself. I think it really helped me to better visualize the way the x/y/z axis worked, and now I can plot points much faster.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I would do each shape at a time, but try to complete it. That means I would plot the points, add the color or the texture, figurte out how the normals would be for the lighting, and then put it into position before starting on the next shape. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

While I likely wont be doing any more 3D visualization/coding, I still think that I could apply my "take it one step at a time" mantra that I used to create each individual shape in future coding projects. It helped me to be a lot less overwhelmed when I looked at it in pieces rather than as a whole.

How do I approach developing programs?

I feel like this is kind of the same as my first answer was. I do research on the IDE that i'll be using and then I go from there in terms of making sure I understand the language that needs to be used. I do like to take these step by step as well, and when possible, I like to look at other peoples work that might be similar in order to make sure I really have a grasp on what I am doing myself.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I had to stop looking at the program as a whole and really break it down one by one in order to get things to run. With this program in particular, there were so many instances where doing one little thing wrong could make the whole thing not run. I know thats the case in a lot of programs, but man it would hurt when I wouldn't even understand what was messed up. 

How did iteration factor into your development?

I'm assuming this means how we broke the main project down into bit by bit each module. It was really helpful because I didn't end up on week seven feeling very overwhelmed by the work that needed to be done.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I'd say my answer for this one is the same as what it was in my earlier answers. Taking it step by step helped me more than I could even explain. However, sometimes it did suck when the code for the secondary assignments was so different then what the tutorials were.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

It's going to help me become an officer in the military because it is a highly demanded career field. I know that the skills I'm learning now are going to be very important in possible future work I will be doing.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

There aren't any other graphics courses that I am taking before finishing my degree, however there are going to be times where I need to stop, take a breath, and take it one step at a time in the future.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Should I be accepted into the comissioning program, hopefully I'll have more opportunities to work with an agency in the future to help exploit our enemies.
